## Installation and Setup
1. Clone the repository:
-  git clone <repository_url>
2. Navigate to the project directory:
 . cd restaurant
3. Create and activate a virtual environment:
. python3 -m venv env
. source env/bin/activate  # On Windows: env\Scripts\activate
4.Install dependencies:
- pip install -r requirements.txt
5. Set up environment variables (e.g., in .env file):
- SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
- DEBUG=True
- DATABASE_URL=your_database_url
6.Run database migrations:
- python manage.py migrate
7. Start the development server:
- python manage.py runserver
## Deployment
### Steps to Deploy to Heroku:
1. Create a Heroku app.
2. Set up environment variables on Heroku.
3. Push the code to the Heroku remote repository.
4. Run migrations on Heroku:
- heroku run python manage.py migrate
5. Test the deployment to ensure functionality.
